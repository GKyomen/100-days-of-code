# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the book up until chapter 2

**Thoughts:**

- This book is really good in maintaining the reader focus. Also, Rust was made on top of a great challenge: balancing developer experience and performance, and I really appreciate that effort!

- I enjoyed doing the game and now I'm thinking about coding some sorting algorithms to practice today's learning.

### Day 2: February 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the book up until chapter 3

**Thoughts:**

- Rust continues to show its care to safety through the book after showing how it implements common programming languages concepts, like the compiler error when possibly accessing an out of bounds array position. I like that!

- This chapter ends with some interesting suggestions about real projects to implement. I'll do it tomorrow.

### Day 3: February 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Made a fibonacci calculator and a temperature converter.

**Thoughts:**

- Today I've put my learnings to the test. It was good to practice the common concepts, like loops, match expressions and the difference between statements and expressions.

- Rust continues to impress me about code safety, but I still wish a language that can infer types over numbers during compile time, which is not present either in Rust or Typescript.

### Day 4: February 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the book up until chapter 4

**Thoughts:**

- Today I've learned about Rust most talked concept: Ownership. For someone who already has experienced pointers in C, the book shows pretty well why they took this idea to the language project.

- At the same time, this was the most difficult chapter to read up until now. There is a ton to learn, and I'm certain that it will only be possible through hands-on programming.

- One other thing that impresses me is how this concept forces the developers not only to look to possible bugs (undefined behavior) but also to look at logical errors, like how a function to append a title to a person's name (i.e PhD) could be fixed in three different manners, but only one was correct because it didn't changed the original person's name forever, which would probably be bad in the program context.

### Day 5: March 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the book up until chapter 5

**Thoughts:**

- This chapter was a bit easier to understand as I saw structs in C and OOP in Java before.

- The book continues to show how important is to understand ownership to develop the best solutions in Rust. I'm planning to do a project to study it more deeply.

### Day 6: March 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the book up until chapter 6

**Thoughts:**

- This chapter was really easier to understand as enums exists in Typescript and match was used before in chapter 2. Because of that, little work has been done in code today

- As the book states, after seeing Rust "null" (None, to be more precise) and enums implementations, I wish it had been like this in all other languages.

- Ownership inventory is a really good way to test our learnings on ownership, but it crashed my browser twice. Note to self: close some tabs before trying this kind of quiz.
