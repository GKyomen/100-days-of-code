# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the book up until chapter 2

**Thoughts:**

- This book is really good in maintaining the reader focus. Also, Rust was made on top of a great challenge: balancing developer experience and performance, and I really appreciate that effort!

- I enjoyed doing the game and now I'm thinking about coding some sorting algorithms to practice today's learning.
