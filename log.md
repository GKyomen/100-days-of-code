# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the book up until chapter 2

**Thoughts:**

- This book is really good in maintaining the reader focus. Also, Rust was made on top of a great challenge: balancing developer experience and performance, and I really appreciate that effort!

- I enjoyed doing the game and now I'm thinking about coding some sorting algorithms to practice today's learning.

### Day 2: February 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the book up until chapter 3

**Thoughts:**

- Rust continues to show its care to safety through the book after showing how it implements common programming languages concepts, like the compiler error when possibly accessing an out of bounds array position. I like that!

- This chapter ends with some interesting suggestions about real projects to implement. I'll do it tomorrow.
